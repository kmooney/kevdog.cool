Blocko is a client-server falling blocks game. 
Blocko is a rust library that knows how to play
a certain familiar game where you try to make lines
to make the fallen blocks go away. Blocko is a Telnet
daemon running at [blocko.kevkev.dev](telnet://blocko.kevkev.dev).

At first I called this thing &ldquo;Tetrix,&rdquo; but it seems to me like the
name is too similar to a certain registered trademark and all that.
So now it's called &ldquo;Blocko.&rdquo;

Maybe one day, I&rsquo;ll make more Blocko middlewares. Right now, you can only interact with Blocko via Telnet.
