This is one Nik and I worked on together, for Ludum Dare 47. It was a fun
project! I kept trying to make the game harder by messing around with the
controls, and he kept trying to make it easier and more approachable. I made the music and sound, some of the graphics (I think I figured out how to make the shaders for shiny surfaces on the loops), Nik figured out how to make the spaceship follow any 3D path (though in our release for the jam, it only follows a looping path)and he knows what a &ldquo;quaternion&rdquo; is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. We borrowed the code to generate the starfield from a dentist office&rsquo;s website.
