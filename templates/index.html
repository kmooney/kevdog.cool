            I&rsquo;m Kevin, and I am a person living in Austin Texas.
            I like making odd things to share with my friends, and this is a place
            for sharing those things. During the day, I work on seller tools at 
            <a target="bc_" href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and the rest of the time, I futz around with music 
            and I read some books. I make games sometimes. I'm trying to think of this as a &ldquo;notebook&rdquo; rather than a very public place.
