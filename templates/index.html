            Iâ€™m Kevin, and I am a person living in Austin Texas.
            During the day, I work on seller tools at 
            <a target="bc_" href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and the rest of the time, I futz around with music 
            and I read some books. I make games sometimes. I helped start a video store. Iâ€™m trying to think of this as a <i>notebook</i> rather than a very public place.
